## Arduino RFID Gym Access Control Project

Welcome to my Arduino RFID Gym Access Control project! This project enhances gym access using Arduino, RFID technology, and LED indicators. Authorized members can swipe RFID cards for access, triggering a green LED. Unauthorized attempts elicit no response.

### Features:
- **RFID Reader Integration:** Detects and reads RFID cards.
- **LED Indicators:** Green LED signals authorized access.
- **Customizable:** Configurable for specific gym needs.
- **Simple Integration:** Easily connects to existing access systems.

Explore the repository for documentation, circuits, and code. Let's revolutionize gym access control together!
